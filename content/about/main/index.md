intro: |
    I graduated from The **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill** with my doctorate in cognitive psychology back in 2021. There, I worked with [Jennifer Arnold](https://jenniferarnold.web.unc.edu/) on researching the cognitive mechanisms underlying how people deal with ambiguous language, like pronouns.<br><br>After graduation, I became a researcher at the **University of Colorado Boulder** with the Institute of Cognitive Science. I worked with [Albert     Kim](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/kimlab/al-kim) and [Jared Novick](https://hesp.umd.edu/facultyprofile/novick/jared) on        projects involving  electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking to extract measures related to executive   function and language processing.<br><br>In my downtime, I am a functional ceramicist, specializing in wheel-thrown pottery. See my [ceramics portfolio](https://vlanglois.com/pottery/) for an online gallery of my work.
