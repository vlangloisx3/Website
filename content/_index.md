description: |
  I am an applied data scientist, interested in topics related to machine learning, statistical modeling, data visualization, and cognition. I really enjoy problem-solving and scripting in **R & Python**.<br><br> I am also a functional ceramicist. You can find an [online gallery](https://vlanglois.com/pottery/) of my current and past work, or head to my [store](https://primspottery.com) if you want to buy one of my pieces.
